# Flask_Project


### UI:
The UI design of this academic association website is based on the theme of neuroscience, using bright and lively colors as the foundation. The overall design aims to create a visually appealing interface that is both modern and intuitive. The website features a clean, organized layout that is easy to navigate and encourages user engagement.

### UX:
Vue3 is used as the primary development framework for the user experience (UX) design. In addition to the basic interactive interface with user login and logout functions, the website includes other common academic website features such as:

- Search functionality: Users can search for specific information within the website, including events, news, and member profiles.
- Member profiles: Registered users can create and manage their own profiles, which may include personal information, academic background, and research interests.
- Discussion forums: Users can participate in online discussions about topics related to the academic association's mission and goals.
- Newsletter subscriptions: Users can sign up to receive regular updates about the latest news, events, and publications from the academic association.

### Backend:
Flask is the primary development framework for the backend. The website's backend functionality includes user authentication and registration, data processing and storage, server-side API integration, and other features necessary for managing an academic association website.

### Database:
The website uses a flexible database structure that can be adapted to meet the unique requirements of the academic association. Data can be securely stored and accessed by authorized users, including member information, event registrations, discussion forum posts, and other important data points.

In summary, this academic association website features a visually engaging and intuitive UI design, with a clean and organized layout that is easy to navigate. The UX design leverages Vue3 to create a seamless user experience, with common academic website features such as search functionality, member profiles, discussion forums, and newsletter subscriptions. The Flask backend provides necessary functionality for managing the website, while the flexible database structure ensures that data can be securely stored and accessed by authorized users.

接下來，您可以根據專案架構，選擇使用Vue3或其他前端語言開始編寫程式碼。當您完成一部分程式碼之後，我將告訴您在專案的哪個路徑中放置檔案。
例如，如果您創建了一個名為Header.vue的Vue component，您應將其放置在frontend/src/components/文件夾中。
