1. Create a new folder named 'frontend' inside the Flask_Project folder to keep all the frontend files. Your updated folder structure should look like this:

    ```
    Flask_Project/
    ├── frontend/
    ├── other files...
    ```

2. Since we're using Vue3 for the frontend development, start by installing Vue CLI globally:

    ```
    npm i -g @vue/cli
    ```

3. Then, create a new Vue project inside the 'frontend' folder:

    ```
    cd Flask_Project/frontend
    vue create my-project
    ```

4. After creating the project, navigate to the 'src' folder inside the 'my-project' folder. Here, we will create the required components and views. According to the README.md, the project contains the following sections:

    - User registration and login
    - Home page
    - User dashboard
    - To-Do list management (create, read, update, and delete tasks)

5. Based on the requirements, create the following components and views:

    - Components:
        - Navbar.vue (for the navigation bar)
        - LoginForm.vue (for the user login form)
        - RegisterForm.vue (for the user registration form)

    - Views:
        - HomePage.vue (for the home page)
        - Dashboard.vue (for the user dashboard)
        - TodoList.vue (for the to-do list management)

6. Here's a brief overview of each component and view:

    - Navbar.vue: Design a simple navigation bar with links to Home, Register, and Login.
    - LoginForm.vue: Design a login form with input fields for email and password, as well as a submit button.
    - RegisterForm.vue: Design a registration form with input fields for name, email, and password, as well as a submit button.
    - HomePage.vue: Design a simple homepage welcoming the user and providing brief information about the project.
    - Dashboard.vue: Design a user dashboard displaying the user's profile and the to-do list. Include a button to create new tasks.
    - TodoList.vue: Design a section for managing the to-do list. Display the tasks in a list or table, and provide buttons for editing and deleting tasks.

7. Update the main router file (src/router/index.js) to include routes for the newly created views.

8. Run the Vue development server to test the frontend:

    ```
    cd my-project
    npm run serve
    ```

9. Once you have finished designing the frontend and tested it locally, you can build the production-ready files by running:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

10. This will create a 'dist' folder containing the compiled frontend files. You can upload this folder to your GitHub repository in the 'frontend' directory.
